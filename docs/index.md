Despite having the highest genomic diversity of any continent, African populations are the least studied in the context of human genetic variation. 

The African Genome Variation Database ([AGVD](https://agvd.h3abionet.org/)) aims to maximize the utility of available variant data gathered from studies of African cohorts and other cohorts with African-ancestry. We expect researchers focusing on African populations or diseases to find novel value in the AGVD as a resource, not only through the search and visualization features but also from its focus on presenting African data. 


AGVD's primary objectives are to:
 - Maximize benefit from and access to variant frequencies from African populations.
 - Provide search and visualization capabilities, enabling researchers to explore genetic data by study, ethnic group, and specific variants. 
 - Provide insights into the clinical relevance of SNPs by presenting annotations from internal and external sources. 
 - Allow more targeted search in terms of allele frequencies, eg rare disease searches.
 - Promote interoperability with other projects by adopting GA4GH standards such as Beacons, VRS, and Passport


The initial release of AGVD reports allele frequencies from a joint called set of ~4000 samples. Future releases will incorporate genotypes from targeted, exome, and additional full genome sequencing, as well as genotyping by arrays.
