    The AGVD frequencies reported are calculated from a joint-called high coverage set of ~4000 samples from various projects both public and restricted. The samples' countries of origin and the projects that made them available are illustrated above. A more detailed summary of the samples and their source projects can be found <a href="summaries.html">here</a>.
