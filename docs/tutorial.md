Introduction

The African Genome Variation Database (AGVD) serves as a resource for researchers worldwide engaged in genomic studies on African populations, but is also useful for global population data comparison. Offering accessibility to minor allele frequencies (MAF) for African populations at a more granular level than is currently available in other resources, AGVD acts as a useful tool for African genomics research. 

Search The Database
To access AGVD, simply click on the following link: https://agvd.h3abionet.org/. Once you've accessed the database, you'll be able to explore a wealth of African-specific variant information along with their annotations and metadata. The search functionality is versatile, allowing users to search using different criteria such as gene names, variant IDs, or specific genomic regions.

On the same homepage, users can explore a world map view presenting the number of samples per population along with their corresponding projects. This feature utilizes data to visually represent the sample counts and their associated projects, all displayed based on their geographical locations.

Search by variant: The search bar enables users to search for variants using various formats, including Reference Sequence (RefSeq) identifiers (e.g., rs116600158), Ensembl gene or transcript identifiers (e.g., ENSG00000100342, ENST00000397278), or genomic locations or ranges (e.g., 19:7177679:C:T)

Results
The following section discusses the results pages in relation to results obtained from BRCA searches.




4.1 Filter variants

On the results page, users are presented with a comprehensive list of filter parameters. Users can access these filters by interacting with the accordion menu in the filter panel. The available filter menus in the pilot release include “Cluster,” “Allele Frequency,” “VariantIDs,” “Variant Type,” “Region,” and “External Reference.” Each filter menu, when expanded, provides explanatory text to assist users in understanding the acceptable types of parameters, the correct format for inputting them, and examples of valid search terms for each type of filter parameter.
