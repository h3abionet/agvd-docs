#### How is the overall "AGVD" allele frequency calculated?

Only the cohorts considered to be predominantly of African ancestry were used to calculate this frequency. This means that ASW and ACB were included even though those samples were not collected on the African continent

#### The variant I'm looking for does not appear to be in AGVD.

- Try searching by location
- If the variant is still not found this could be due to:
 - It having been filtered out in the joint calling
 - The variant being ref/ref for all the samples
